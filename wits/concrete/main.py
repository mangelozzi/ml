#%% 0. Import the python libraries you think you'll require

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


#%% 1. Load in the data. This can be done in a number of ways.
#   e.g. dataFrame = pd.read_csv('path to data file')
df = pd.read_csv('concrete_data.csv')


#%% 2. Explore the data.
#
#   2.1 Visualise the data (How do the predictors/inputs relate to the responses/outputs?)



#%% 3. Formulate the Problem
#   Decide on the predictors and the responses. If you had to implement this model
#   with live data streaming in, waht would it look like? Include pre-processing
#   where appropriate.



#%% 4. Create Baseline Model for Comparison
#   This is typically something extremely naive and simple. A "back-of-an-envelope"
#   attempt at the problem. Typical examples include assuming all the data belongs
#   to a single class (classification), or assuming the current prediction equals
#   the previous prediction (time series regression)


#%% 5. Identify a Suitable Machine Learning Model



#%% 6. Compare your Model to the Baseline
#   Use the appropriate performance metrics where appropriate.
#   Classification - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, AUC, ROC, etc.
#   Regression - MSE, Error distributions, R-squared


#%% 7. Add Complexity if Required

#%% 8. Repeat the Analysis as required

#%% 9. Answer the Question
